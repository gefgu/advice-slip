## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- CSS Modules
- Framer Motion
- SWR

### What I learned

I learned that Framer Motion is AMAZING! I've added several nice animations to this project and it was the easiest part.

### Continued development

If kept working on this project, I would improve my handling of the API calls. I don't think my solution using a random index was the best way to avoid the caching of the advices.
